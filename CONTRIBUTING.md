Hi there! Thanks for wanting to contribute :) 

The [README](https://github.com/niryariv/opentaba-server) explains how to get the code set up on your machine. For questions, please contact niryariv or alonisser - you'll find us at gmail. 

Please note that the front end code is in another repo [opentaba-client](https://github.com/niryariv/opentaba-server) - in case that's more up your alley. 

Welcome aboard!
